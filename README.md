# Minimal OpenMP + CUDA sample in C++

Refer to [starter repo](https://github.com/tornikeo/minimal-vscode-cuda-meson) on setting this up with vscode + meson.

**This is heavily work-in-progress.**

Shows a sample of using OpenMP with CUDA, with multiple CPUs batching their requests to query the GPU at the same time.
